# learning-moveit

## 1. Introduction

This ros metapackage contains some packages that I wrote it myself according to the tutorials provided by the MoveIt! official website. The MoveIt! Tutorials website is: http://docs.ros.org/kinetic/api/moveit_tutorials/html/index.html. **Before you begin to learn, you must first glance at the following [Notes](#4-notes)**!  

### 1.1 Basic Components

- **panda_bringup**: The panda_bringup package provides roslaunch for starting panda_arm_hand motion planning and simulation test.
- **panda_description**: The panda_description package provides a complete 3D model of the panda_arm_hand for simulation and visualization.

### 1.2 Motion Simulation

- **panda_gazebo**: The panda_gazebo package can launch panda_arm_hand in gazebo simulator.
- **panda_gazebo_controller_config**: The panda_gazebo_controller_config package provides controller configuration files for simulating panda_arm_hand in gazebo.

### 1.3 Motion Control

- **panda_teleop**: The panda_teleop package can control panda_arm_hand by using keyboard.

### 1.4 Motion Planning

- **panda_moveit_config**: The panda_moveit_config package provides configuration and launch files for using the panda_arm_hand with the MoveIt! Motion Planning Framework.
- **panda_moveit_control**: The panda_moveit_control package provides motion planning and control for panda_arm_hand by using kinematics.

## 2. Installation

- Installing ROS packages.
```sh
$> roscd
$> cd ../src
$> git clone https://github.com/myyerrol/learning-moveit.git
$> cd ..
$> rosdep install -y --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro kinetic
$> cd src/learning-moveit
$> ./setup.sh
```

- Building ROS packages.
```sh
$> roscd
$> cd ..
$> catkin_make
```

## 3. Usage

## 4. Notes

### 4.1 Controller Warning

When you run `panda_bringup_gazebo.launch` or `panda_bringup_gazebo_and_moveit.launch`, you will notice that the terminal will output following some warning messages:

```txt
[ WARN] [1534040926.378110292, 0.132000000]: The default_robot_hw_sim plugin is using the Joint::SetPosition method without preserving the link velocity.
[ WARN] [1534040926.378135775, 0.132000000]: As a result, gravity will not be simulated correctly for your model.
[ WARN] [1534040926.378288871, 0.132000000]: Please set gazebo_pid parameters, switch to the VelocityJointInterface or EffortJointInterface, or upgrade to Gazebo 9.
[ WARN] [1534040926.378348094, 0.132000000]: For details, see https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/612
```

As mentioned above, the `PositionJointInterface` can't simulate gravity in Gazebo. It must use the `VelocityJointInterface` or `EffortJointInterface`. But because setting the PID parameters of the panda manipulator is very complicated and time-consuming, I chose the `PositionJointInterface` to reduce the workload. **The result is that when the velocity and amplitude of the panda manipulator exceeds a certain value, the entire panda manipulator will fly in Gazebo**! I hope that someone will be able to solve this problem thoroughly.

### 4.2 MoveIt Sensor Error

When you run `panda_moveit_config/launch/demo.launch` or other moveit launch files, you will notice that the terminal will output following some error messages:

```txt
[ERROR] [1534042979.682769522]: XmlRpc Exception: type error
[ERROR] [1534042979.682802441]: Failed to configure updater of type PointCloudUpdater
```

I haven't found a solution to this problem for a long time on Google, and I'm sure there's no problem with the `panda_moveit_config/config/sensors_xtion.yaml ` file. If someone has encountered similar problem, I hope he can provide a solution, thanks.

### 4.3 Gazebo Pick Error

Whenever I remotely control panda manipulator to grasp ojbects on the cabinet in Gazebo, objects will always be flown at the moment the end effector is clamped. About this problem, I analyzed the possible reason is that the parameters of the Gazebo simulation are not set correctly. Of course, there may be other reasons. I wrote it down first, and if I have a chance and enough time latter I'll fix it.
